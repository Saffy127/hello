    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
        Taking your regular chocolate chip to the next level.
        Soft and chewy full of chocolate chips, those cookie's flavor is un paralled by any other recipe.
        <br>And when you add dried cranberries and white chocolate to it, the flavor 
        is exponentially off the charts. <br>A very straight forward recipe that is amazingly delicious and that turns out perfectly every single time.

    </p>

    <p>
      I created this recipe over 10 years ago and like clockwork, it is the first recipe that my family asks for under the holidays. 
      <br>I really love to use and mix dark chocolate with white chocolate. <br> 
      The blended flavor is just sinful and additive at every bite. But not all kinds of chocolate.
      <br>Ghirardelli or Guittard and bittersweet chocolate for the dark chocolate. 
      <br>  I love to use bittersweet, dark chocolate, the flavor is deeper.
       <br>Cranberries are my favorite and use them as often as I possibly can in my cooking. 
      Leave them whole or chop them, I leave that up to you.
